# Cross-Chain (Juno) randomness

## Cross-Chain Random Numbers Demo

This documentation serves as a demo on how to send **cross-chain random numbers from Secret Network testnet to Juno testnet via IBC**. The demo repository [can be cloned here](https://github.com/scrtlabs/examples/tree/master/secret-ibc-rng-template).&#x20;

The system we will be working with for this demo consists of **two Juno contracts and one Secret contract**:

* [**Juno Consumer Contract**](https://github.com/scrtlabs/examples/tree/master/secret-ibc-rng-template/consumer/src): A Juno contract that consumes the random numbers generated by the Secret proxy contract.
  * [`DoSomething`](https://github.com/scrtlabs/examples/blob/14092494ba9ff6697b50eb293d6c9633335acc41/secret-ibc-rng-template/consumer/src/contract.rs#L57C8-L57C8): Triggers a request for a random number from the Juno Proxy Contract.
  * [`RandomResponse`](https://github.com/scrtlabs/examples/blob/14092494ba9ff6697b50eb293d6c9633335acc41/secret-ibc-rng-template/consumer/src/contract.rs#L68): Receives the random number from the Juno Proxy Contract and stores it in the Contract's storage.
* [**Juno Proxy Contract**](https://github.com/scrtlabs/examples/tree/master/secret-ibc-rng-template/consumer-side-proxy/src)**:**  A Juno contract that executes[`RequestRandom`](https://github.com/scrtlabs/examples/blob/14092494ba9ff6697b50eb293d6c9633335acc41/secret-ibc-rng-template/consumer-side-proxy/src/contract.rs#L72) and sends an IBC message to fetch the random number from the Secret Network proxy contract.&#x20;
* [**Secret Proxy Contract**](https://github.com/scrtlabs/examples/tree/master/secret-ibc-rng-template/proxy/src): A Secret contract that requests a random number via [`RequestRandom`](https://github.com/scrtlabs/examples/blob/14092494ba9ff6697b50eb293d6c9633335acc41/secret-ibc-rng-template/proxy/src/contract.rs#L158) and specifies the callback information for the response.

{% hint style="info" %}
The Secret proxy contract will produce a _different, non-predictable_ number for each request it receives. You can read more about random numbers on Secret Network in the [technical specification of this feature.](../../secret-contract-fundamentals/available-native-features-modules/secret-vrf-on-chain-randomness.md)
{% endhint %}

See here for a diagram of the system architecture:&#x20;

### Environment Configuration

There are two steps to configuring your environment:&#x20;

1. Upload and instantiate the three smart contracts ([requires installing Junod](https://docs.junonetwork.io/validators/getting-setup))
2. Configure an IBC relayer to properly relay packets between your chains of choice (for this demo we will use [Hermes](https://hermes.informal.systems/index.html)).&#x20;

#### Upload and instantiate Secret Smart Contract

To begin, let's upload and instantiate the Secret Network proxy smart contract with Secret.js. [Clone the repository](https://github.com/scrtlabs/examples/tree/master/secret-ibc-rng-template), then `cd` into `node`. Run `npm i` to install the dependencies. Then, update the file [`index_secret.js`](https://github.com/scrtlabs/examples/blob/14092494ba9ff6697b50eb293d6c9633335acc41/secret-ibc-rng-template/node/index\_secret.js#L7) to include your wallet mnemonic like so:&#x20;

```javascript
const wallet = new Wallet("your wallet words go here");
```

Next, upload and instantiate the smart contract. If you need guidance doing so, [refer to the docs here.  ](https://docs.scrt.network/secret-network-documentation/development/getting-started/interacting-with-the-testnet#uploading-with-secret.js)Or, simply use the Secret smart contract that has already been instantiated here:

```
secret1rmccmgwf6zf2kawrv7h5faq3tx883epz7ty6tj
```

#### Upload and instantiate Juno Smart Contracts&#x20;

Now that we have our Secret proxy contract, let's upload and instantiate the two consumer smart contracts.&#x20;

{% hint style="info" %}
You can configure the consumer contracts for any IBC-compatible chain of your choosing. However, for this demo will be uploading and instantiating our contracts on Juno.&#x20;
{% endhint %}

First, download the wasm files for the two Juno contracts:

* [Juno Consumer Contract wasm file](https://github.com/scrtlabs/examples/blob/master/secret-ibc-rng-template/consumer/target/wasm32-unknown-unknown/release/consumer.wasm)
* [Juno Proxy Contract wasm file  ](https://github.com/scrtlabs/examples/blob/master/secret-ibc-rng-template/consumer-side-proxy/target/wasm32-unknown-unknown/release/secret\_ibc\_rng\_template.wasm)

Next, upload them to Juno testnet using [Juno tools](https://test.juno.tools/contracts/upload/).&#x20;

{% hint style="info" %}
To upload the Juno contracts to Juno testnet, you need Juno testnet tokens in your wallet, which you can request from their [discord faucet](https://discord.com/channels/816256689078403103/842073995059003422).
{% endhint %}

Upon successful upload, you will see a success message, along with a transaction hash and code ID:&#x20;

<figure><img src="../../../.gitbook/assets/juno upload.png" alt=""><figcaption></figcaption></figure>

Note the code ID for both contracts, as you will need this to instantiate the smart contracts on Juno. Now to instantiate the contracts, make sure you have [Junod installed](https://docs.junonetwork.io/validators/getting-setup). To check for successful installation run `junod version` in your terminal. I am currently running `v11.0.0.`&#x20;

Next, instantiate the Juno proxy contract by running the following:&#x20;

{% code overflow="wrap" %}
```
junod tx wasm instantiate <codeId> '{"init": {}' --label 'juno-proxy' --no-admin --from <your juno wallet> --gas 200000 -y --chain-id uni-6 --node https://uni-rpc.reece.sh:443 --gas-prices 0.025ujunox
```
{% endcode %}

{% hint style="info" %}
To add a wallet to junod, run the following your terminal:

&#x20;**`junod keys add <your wallet name>`**
{% endhint %}

Then, to query that the instantiation was successful and find the contract address, query the returned `txHash` with:

```
junod q tx <txHash> --node https://uni-rpc.reece.sh:443
```

You should see the `contract_address` variable. Mine is `juno1ecl4r6dhhlluz56jqm24t6ss7s9gr6d0pu2lumvpwnnk56gnw7gqpz8m6c` ðŸ™Œ

Now, simply repeat the process for the Juno Consumer contract. The only difference is that the instantiation message is slightly modified because it needs to include the other Juno contract address that we just instantiated as a pointer:&#x20;

{% code overflow="wrap" %}
```markup
junod tx wasm instantiate <your code id> '{"init": {"rand_provider": { "address": <your juno contract address>, "code_hash": ""}}}' --label 'juno-consumer' --no-admin --from <your wallet name> --gas 300000 -y --chain-id uni-6 --node https://uni-rpc.reece.sh:443  --gas-prices 0.025ujunox
```
{% endcode %}

My contract address is `juno1z4n39vfckeuv6udx6f4e6h8d5mt3xucuwdjs6lk2ets60ejruseqnpt00k`  ðŸ™Œ
