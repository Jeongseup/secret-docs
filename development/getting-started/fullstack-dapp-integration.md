# Fullstack dApp Integration

## Millionaire Problem Decentralized Application

Yao's Millionaires' problem is a secure multi-party computation problem introduced in 1982 by computer scientist and computational theorist Andrew Yao. The problem discusses two millionaires, Alice and Bob, who are interested in knowing which of them is richer without revealing their actual wealth.&#x20;

[The Secret smart contract](https://github.com/scrtlabs/MillionaireProblemTutorial/tree/master) we will be working with demonstrates an example implementation that allows two millionaires to submit their net worth and determine who is richer, without revealing their actual net worth.&#x20;

[This is the source code](https://github.com/writersblockchain/yaos-millionaire-problem-dapp/tree/master/node) for the full stack application. In this demo you will learn how to **integrate the Secret Millionaire contract with React using Secret.Js.** Let's get started! &#x20;
